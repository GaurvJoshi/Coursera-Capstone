The survey of over 1,000 respondents in Delhi-NCR, both men and women in age group of 18-45, also found that poor self-image and lifestyle disorders was a common worry among the obese people.\nObesity in India has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st century, with morbid obesity affecting 5% of the country's population. India is following a trend of other developing countries that are steadily becoming more obese.\n\nIn India, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased rapidly in recent decades. Given the association between overweight and obesity with many non-communicable diseases, forecasts of the future prevalence of overweight and obesity can help inform policy in a country where around one sixth of the world\u2019s population resides."

A company *XYZ* wanted to start a gym chain in Delhi so we might suggest them some place for their gyms.\nWhere they can atleast work on their health and keep them fit because according to Centre of Diease Control(CDC), 45-60 mins are enough for one them to keep them healthy. As these gyms will be available to them in their neighborhood so they can easily reachout their.\n\nThe target market for these gyms would be the entire community in which it resides, as the gym would provide ample variety in activities that all age groups from adolescent to senior citizen would be able to partake and benefit from the physical activity, promoting healthier lifestyles and aiding in the prevention of obesity in Delhi."
